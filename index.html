        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
            I am Jeremy Waweru, an aspiring software developer passionate about creating innovative solutions.
            My journey began with a curiosity to solve real-world problems, and that fascination has grown into a strong desire to build impactful software.
            I'm constantly inspired by the ability to create something from scratch that can help improve people's lives, whether it's a small tool or a large-scale application.
            My goal is to continuously learn, grow, and challenge myself to be a better developer, staying curious and adaptable in this fast-evolving field.
