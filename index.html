        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi I'm JEREMY WAWERU,welcome to my portfolio I am deeply passionate about software development and excited about the endless possibilities it offers. 
           From an early age, I've been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems, and that fascination has grown into a strong desire to build impactful software.
           I'm constantly inspired by the ability to create something from scratch that can help improve people's lives, whether it's a small tool or a large-scale application.
           My goal is to continuously learn, grow, and challenge myself to be a better developer, staying curious and adaptable in this fast-evolving field.
